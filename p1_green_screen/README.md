###Introduction 
Ah, the life of being a teaching assistant at UGA. It’s a rewarding experience, but lacks the perks of some more interesting jobs. The goal of this assignment is to help our illustrious head TA Sagar feel the experience of traveling without him spending a dime! 
 
To do this, we’re going to implement some trickery using Java. If you’ve ever watched a weather forecast, you’ve seen some trickery in action, referred to commonly as a greenscreen. The weather guesser stands in front of a large panel of green, and then software magically replaces the green space with images of satellite imager, radar, etc. for viewers at home. Wait, it’s not magic, it’s science!  Computer science! 
 
In this project, you will use Java to build a simple algorithm that you might see being used at a television station, or even in the film special effects industry. You will write a program that processes an image specified by the user, replacing the background with the background of another image, both of which are specified by the user.  Finally, you will save the image to a filename as specified by the user.

This lovely person is standing in front of a greenscreen where the image is replaced with a terrific shot of the Golden Gate Bridge. 
 
Note, her positioning is mirrored; in this project, you aren’t required to mirror an image.
