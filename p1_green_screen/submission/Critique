Everything that I layed out was there, but as stated in the instructions, we
had to have the main color changer in one method, and the code that actually
writes the final file in another method. This brings in some challenges,
starting with you have to transfer the opened BufferedImage stream open and
set it as the arguments of the writer method. I did not have any compromises
with this project, I even was able to implement a auto method which picks the
color of highest count and removes that particular color. The program has been
tested with png and jpg, green and white images.
