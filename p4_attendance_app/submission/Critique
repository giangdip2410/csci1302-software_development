Design Document Critique:
Our initial design document UML was very close, but a little off in terms of method names, and how many methods and listeners that were actually implemented. We had to do so some serious searching throuhg the java api and the help tutorials on how to actually display the data in a meaningfull and analytical way. Our goal was to be able to analyze each student with a single click of the mouse. Also we wanted to click to analyze the whole class at one time. We used a JTable and painted the blocks red for absence and green for attended. This gives a very good visual representation for any educator looking over attendance. Also we provided a JProgressBar at the bottm which gives a percentage and visual way similar to a glass half full or empty display of attendance. While showing which days each student attended, and having the progress at the bottom, we believe that this is a good representation on how to display attendance records. We have gone through and exaustively optimised our code to be as lean and possible but retain all the functionality. We beleive this is the most efficient version of our app possible and we have removed all unncecssary code. Overall this project took many hours of pair programming and turned out with a good result. UML was almost but very close to delvery application code specifications.
