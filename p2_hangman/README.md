##CSCI-1302 Project 2
Software Design  
Spring 2012 – University of Georgia  
Hang Man  
Revised 2/8/2012 


Item | Description
---- | -----------
Goals | 1) Implement inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces in a software project <br> 2) Understand and experience the principles behind pair programming <br> 3) Implement a client class using a predefined class, given API documentation 
Points | This project is worth 75 points
Due Date | This project is due by 11 pm on February 21, 2012 <br> The UML design document is due by 11 pm on February 10, 2012. You may submit your UML document up to 2-days late (until 11 pm on February 12, 2012) without penalty. 
Late Penalty | Otherwise, 12% off the maximum original point value is deducted for each 24-hour period the programming assignment is late for up to two days late. <br> Saturday/Sunday count as one day. 
Collaboration Policy | For this assignment, you may only collaborate with your assigned pair programming partner. <br> We expect you to abide by standard pair programming policies; all code that is written that is submitted must be written with both parties co-located at the same computer. Individuals who do not follow pair programming policies will be penalized. <br> The Java API, Java Tutorials, and the course textbooks are fair resources for this project.

###Project Introduction 
In this project, pair programming teams will be randomly assigned and announced in class.  Each team will be required to design and implement a hangman game.

In this project, pair programming teams will be randomly assigned and announced in class. Each team will be required to design and implement a souped-­‐up version of the classic game, Hangman. Hangman is traditionally a pen-­‐and-­‐paper game where one player thinks of a word and the second person tries to guess it by suggesting letters. The word to guess is represented by “blanks” where the number of blanks is equal to the number of letters in the word. If the guessing player correctly guesses a letter in the word, the other player will write all occurrences of that letter in the word. If the guessed letter is not in the word, the other player will draw one element in the hangman diagram, which is a rudimentary image depicting a hanging man.  An example image is shown on the left, an image that is part of the public domain, designed by Kyle Siehl.
