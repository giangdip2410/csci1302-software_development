Design Document Critique:


Our initial design document UML diagram was a little off in terms
of method names and arguments that they accept. For example, 
all the players under the class Player could have access to the String 
objects in Player if you make them protected instead of private. 
This find was due to teamwork, in which one person remembered that they
could do this from a pervious coding experience. 

One difference was that all of the player's play method was renamed
makeGuess, and they did not need to accept any arguments, as they could
access the parent's protected String objects. Also on our Board 
interface, we did not really need a isFull boolean variable as isWin 
or isLoose could determine the winner, which is where the final decision
is sent over to isGameOver which returns true if the game of hangman is
truly over, win or lose. This projected some researching of how to 
use super to get methods and variables to the child classes. 

Other than that, the actually project comes close to the 
design document UML diagram. We only wish that we could have found
a way to use a single hangman board image for the actual game, instead of
generating a new
 image for every guess. It would have made the program
a little more efficient.
