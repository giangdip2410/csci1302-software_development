Project Introduction 

In this project, you’ll get your feet wet with the graphical user interface (GUI) capabilities of Java. You will create a game using Java’s AWT and Swing. Note, you may not use any GUI builder tools. 
 
Four in a Row is a two-­‐player game where each player takes turns dropping color-­‐coded disks into a row of a grid. You may know this game as Milton Bradley’s Connect Four. The object of the game is to first connect four of a player’s disks next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. 
 
In this project, you will create a graphical user interface to allow 
two humans to play this game. 




Graphical User Interface Specifications 
 
•	The board shall of 7-­‐column and 6-­‐rows a piece. 
•	Generic pieces containing a blank space, red-­‐player, and yellow-­‐player are available on eLC; you 
may create your own pieces if you wish. 
•	The GUI must contain reset button to restart game play. 
•	The GUI must contain a leaderboard to keep score of each player.  This is reset every time the 
application is quit and restarted, or the reset button is pressed. 
•	The GUI should contain a menu bar with a File and Help menu.
